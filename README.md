# RL Tcod

A roguelike game experiment using the libtcod C++ library.

Goals:
- 3 "zones" or hexes of wilderness outside the starting town.
- Each zone is more difficult
- Each zone has a dungeon. Each level of the dungeon is more difficult.
- Static, non-procedural world.
- Movement and basic combat
- line of sight
- no leveling, loot, inventory, conversations. Keep it simple.
